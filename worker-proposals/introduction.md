Thanks Fuzzy
Thanks for hang out 
I’m thrilled to be here!

I am Ryan R. Fox, known simply as ‘fox’ on BitShares and other Graphene-based platforms, as well as the BitSharesTalk Forum and related Telegram channels. 

I have some prepared remarks and have left time at their conclusion to field questions, so I will respectfully request you hold verbal questions until that time. Of course, queue up your questions in the chat window as I proceed.

Today I will introduce a budget worker proposal  titled, “Budget for BitShares Core Team.” 

It's still being drafted, so look for It to be posted early next week in coordination with the BitShares Blockchain Foundation (the BBF). The BBF will provide management oversight, and accounting of the budgeted funds. The intent of this Budget Worker is threefold:

A Budget, A Framework and Software Delivery

1.	Establish a BUDGET to _sustain_ the development efforts of the BitShares Core Team
2.	Define a FRAMEWORK for the Core Team to _collaborate_ within
3.	DELIVER transparent communication of BitShares _development efforts_ to our community

Briefly, some background on why I chose to begin drafting the proposal:
The BitShares Core software is currently maintained by individuals either volunteering their time or receiving funding through distinct short-term worker proposals. The BitShares Community has recognized the need for organized development efforts to increase the utility of our platform. There is a large backlog of ideas and requirements lacking prioritization, including feature enhancements, bug fixes, and BSIPs. Therefore, proposed is the establishment of a long-term, professional, global team dedicated to cohesive and comprehensive development efforts, delivered transparently.

Producing reliable and secure software at scale requires ideation, organization, definition, prioritization, development, testing and documentation. The ideal team composition includes roles specializing in each of these functions and capable of contributing many.

The Core Team being proposed aims to establish a standing team of contributors comprised of the following roles:

1.	Business Analyst
2.	QA/Tester
3.	Documentation Specialist
4.	Core Developer
5.	User Experience Liaison
6.	Coordinator

I envision the BitShares Core Team to become a self-organizing, agile-principled team, focused on delivering regularly scheduled releases of the BitShares Core software. There are two types of development cycles the Core Team will develop for: 

1.	Bug Fixes / Feature Enhancements, targeting three or four-week sprint cycles
2.	Core Release (hard fork), targeting twice annually.

My intent is to serve in the role of Coordinator, drawing on my extensive experience managing software development teams as a scrum master in the financial services, mortgage banking and manufacturing industries. 

Over the past month, I have connected with existing contributors and community members to assemble an initial team able to begin work upon voting approval. The initial team will work in collaboration with the existing funded workers, including Abit, Alfredo Garcia and Bill Butler’s UI Team. Each of them has committed to a handful of hours on the Core Team as they focus primarily on their existing Workers, and provide continuity for coordinated development efforts going forward. In addition, Peter Conrad intends to contribute as a Core Developer, Taconator intends to contribute as a Business Analyst and Tamami Sugimoto as Analyst and Documentation Specialist. Thank you to each of them for supporting this proposal with their expertise. 

I want to give each of them the opportunity to introduce themselves in just a moment, but first in closing, please know that as currently drafted and budgeted: most roles have open time allocations available to well qualified individuals looking to join the BitShares Core Team. You can reach me: 

•	by direct message on the BitSharesTalk Forum
•	within most BitShares Telegram channels 
•	or by email, I’m fox@bitshares.boston

Before I open it up to the community for questions, please allow some of the assembled team to introduce themselves. Let’s go reverse alphabetical order: Tamami, Taconator, Peter, Bill and Alfredo. Abit chose not to speak at this time.

Thanks everybody.
