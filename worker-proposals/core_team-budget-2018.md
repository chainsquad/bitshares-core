Duration and Pay
================

This proposal will last for 11 months, starting from 1st February 2018.

Weekly Payments:
* Invoices from Core Team Members will be submitted to the Coordinator by Monday 12:00 UTC for work performed thru Sunday 23:59 UTC of the previous week
* Coordinator will review and approve submitted invoices, then forward to BitShares Blockchain Foundation for direct payment to Core Team Members
* Coordinator will review and approve vendor invoices, then forward to BitShares Blockchain Foundation for direct payment to vendor

Calculation:
* 2.53 BTS/bitUSD = settlement price of bitUSD at the moment of writing (2018-01-24)
* 2.5 = multiplier to cover market fluctuations and borrow at 2.5x collateral if needed
* $6,246 usd/day * 2.53 bts/usd * 2.5 = 39,506 BTS/day

USD payment will be in bitUSD with method developed by @xeroc [6]. CNY payment may be requested and fulfilled with bitCNY using 6.37 USD/CNY. A Core Team Member must declare their payment method with their first invoice and may not change it during calendar year 2018. Contingency: should world events disrupt the USD/CNY rate by +/- 10%, the invoice will be remitted in bitUSD to honor the budget.
