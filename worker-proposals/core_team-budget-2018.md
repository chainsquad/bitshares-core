BitShares Core Team Budget Worker Proposal - 2018 (`"1.14.XX"`)
===============================================================

Author: Ryan R. Fox (`"fox"`)

Intent
======

* Establish a budget to sustain the development efforts of the BitShares Core Team
* Define a framework for the Core Team to collaborate within
* Deliver transparent communication of BitShares development efforts to the community

Background
==========

Currently the BitShares Core software is maintained by a few gracious individuals either volunteering their time or receiving funding through distinct short-term worker proposals. The BitShares Community has expressed interest securing a long term, dedicated and professional development team capable of more rapidly delivering high value features in a transparent way. BitShares is global platform and so too is the desired development team composition. A large volume of feature enhancements, bug fixes and BSIPs exist for the team to work from.

Backlog (Sample Screenshot)
===========================

![alt text](backlog.png "Sample Backlog using Aha!")

Worker
======

This is a Budget Worker Proposal (`"1.14.XX"`) which provides funding through calendar year 2018 for:
* BitShares Core Team Roles
* Collaboration Tools

It intends to work in concert with the existing development resources including Abit, Alfredo Garcia, and the UI Team, led by Bill Butler. BTS are collected into the `"bitsharesdev"` account (`"1.2.2386"`) which is a multi-sig account controlled by `"BitShares Blockchain Foundation"` and the `"committee-account"` using the Budget Worker Model [5]:

* Transparent accounting provided by the BitShares Blockchain Foundation [6]
* Submitted invoices reviewed, approved and remitted within 5 business days
* Compensation paid in bitUSD (default) or bitCNY (Team Member may define upon first invoice)
* All unused accumulated BTS returned to the Reserve Pool at the conclusion of the Worker

Core Team Roles
===============

The BitShares Core Team is a self-organizing agile-principled team focused on delivering regularly scheduled releases and ad hoc bug fixes for the BitShares Core software. The table below describes the target composition of the team at full utilization for budget purposes only. The actual number of contributors and roles may vary within each development cycle (described below). The team has discretion in allocating resources to meet the needs of each development cycle. A goal is to rapidly grow into and sustain a dedicated team approximating the composition below.

BitShares Core Team Framework:

Collegiality
* Maintain timely collaborative communications with each BitShares Core Team Member
* Target a majority of your weekly hours between Tuesday - Thursday
  * Facilitates ad hoc collaboration
  * Facilitates healthy work/life balance

Transparency
* Maintain working increments within Community facing collaboration tools
* Participate in at least two of three weekly Collaboration Sessions (see Coordinator description)

Delivery
* Deliver the highest value work first
* Deliver working increments with invoice submission
* Favor release schedule over feature completeness

BitShares Core Team Member 'Contract Work' Guidance:
====================================================

This section is to be considered guidance, not a legal statement. The BitShares Decentralized Autonomous Community (BitShares DAC) 'owns' the funds collected by this Budget Worker and are made available as compensation to individuals performing 'contract worker' as described elsewhere in this document. Effort contributed by individuals is considered 'at-will' as no formal 'employment contract' is able to be formed between BitShares DAC and the 'contract worker' at this time. Neither the BitShares Blockchain Foundation (BBF) nor the BitShares Committee or any individuals serving those entities are considered 'employers' of any 'contract worker'. The Coordinator, nor any other BitShares Core Team Member or Role is considered the 'boss' nor an 'employer' of any individual. Any compensation received from the BitShares DEX is likely considered 'earned income' and may be subject to tax reporting by the recipient. The BitShares DAC, BBF, BitShares Committee, Coordinator, nor any Core Team Member will not prepare nor issue 'tax documents' to any entitiy. All effort performed is a 'work for hire' contribution to the BitShares DAC adhering to its MIT license.

The BitShares Core Team value a healthy work/life balance and sustainable compensation. Each Core Team Member is encouraged to contribute no more hours than is customary in their jurisdiction for 'full time equivalent' work, as the role is considered 'exempt' from overtime compensation. A goal is to provide the equivalent of an annual 'salaried position' with two weeks holiday. To accommodate this, the equivalent of 40 hours of 'base pay' will be remitted to the Core Team Member upon accumulating 1000 hours within a rolling 12-month period, thus resetting both counters. National and religious observances are also important to a healthy work/life balance. Up to ten 8-hour 'observance days' are paid per calendar year, prorated to the rate and average working days in the week before and after the week containing the observance day.

Each BitShares Core Team Member performing effort for the BitShares DAC acknowledges no recourse nor remedy is available from the BitShares DAC, any other BitShares Core Team Member nor author.

Duration and Pay
================

This proposal will last for roughly 46 weeks, starting from 12th February 2018.

Payments:
* Invoices from Core Team Members will be submitted to the Coordinator by Monday 12:00 UTC for work performed thru Sunday 23:59 UTC of the previous period
* Coordinator will review and approve submitted invoices, then forward to BitShares Blockchain Foundation for direct payment to Core Team Members
* Coordinator will review and approve vendor invoices, then forward to BitShares Blockchain Foundation for direct payment to vendor

Calculation:
* 1.84 BTS/bitUSD = Settlement price of bitUSD at the moment of writing (2018-01-27)
* 2.5 = Collateral multiplier to cover market fluctuations and borrow with 2.5x collateral, as needed
* $6,667 USD/day * 1.84 BTS/USD * 2.5 collateral multiplier= 30,668 BTS/day

USD payment will be in bitUSD with method developed by @xeroc [8]. CNY payment may be requested and fulfilled with bitCNY using 6.37 USD/CNY. A Core Team Member must declare their payment method with their first invoice and may not change it during calendar year 2018. Contingency: should world events disrupt the USD/CNY rate by +/- 10%, the invoice will be remitted in bitUSD to honor the budget.
